<!-- FOR PROGRAMMERS -->
<div style="font-size:16px;">
<h2 id="for-programmers">For Programmers</h2>

Greetings to my fellow programmers! If you've never used GitHub before, you're definitely going to want to check out the [Guide to Getting Started](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md) in this repository.

The relevant sections you'll want to check out are written there as well, with a guide.

<h3 id="a-few-tips-programmers">A few tips...</h3>

* Please be sure to sync your work here often!
* Make sure to [branch out](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md#branching--forking) (literally) when working on different elements of the project.
* Be [descriptive](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md#committing-guidelines) in your commits and pull requests.

<!-- FOR WRITERS -->
<div style="font-size:16px;">
<h2 id="for-writers">For Writers</h2>

Hello my wonderful and creative writers! You may not be using this repository as much as the programmers. However, since we are integrating the dialogue into YarnSpinner, we will need your help when it comes to indicating event changes in the storyline. Read more in the Writing & Events article.

If you've never used GitHub before, be sure to check out the [Guide to Getting Started](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md) in this repository.

Unlike programmers, you won't have to read as many sections, but there are still important notes and tips for anytime you interact with the repository.

<h3 id="a-few-tips-writers">A few tips...</h3>

* Please be sure to sync your work here often!
* If you plan on editing YarnSpinner scripts directly, please make a [branch](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md#branching--forking) (literally) of the latest stable version.
* Be [descriptive](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md#committing-guidelines) in your commits, especially if there are dialogue changes in a scene.

<!-- FOR ARTISTS/DESIGNERS -->
<div style="font-size:16px;">
<h2 id="for-artists-designers">For Artists/Designers</h2>

Hello my amazing and talented artists and designers! Of all people, you guys will liekly be using this repository the least. However! You still play a very pivotal role in the success of this game.

For the most part, you will be submitting your art to the repository's main [01 Assets](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/tree/main/01%20Assets) folder. However, I still strongly encourage you to check out the [Guide to Getting Started](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md).

Several important topics are covered in there, including how to [commit](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md#how-do-i-commit), how to [maintain the integrity](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md#commit-example) of the project, and more.

Unlike programmers, you won't have to read as many sections, but there are still important notes and tips for anytime you interact with the repository.

<h3 id="a-few-tips-art-design">A few tips...</h3>

* When sharing assets, be [descriptive](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/blob/main/02%20Docs/01%20Information/getting-started.md#committing-guidelines) in the comments!
* Maintain healthy semantics when naming and organizing images.
* Please, do NOT upload assets directly to the [00 Unity Proj](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/tree/main/00%20Unity%20Proj) folder unless you are directly editing the project on your computer. Upload them to the [01 Assets](https://github.com/Nicole-Scalera/MaS/tree/main/01%20Assets) folder at the root of the repository.
